# UNCC_ECE_OPTHOTOOL
This repository contains code to develop OpthoTool. This is a software that will be able to accept the OCT or OCTA scans and utilize AI to output a detailed analysis of the retina.

## OBJECTIVE
The objective of this project is to successfully implement standardized imaging features from optical coherence tomography (OCT) and OCT Angiography (OCTA) retinal imaging devices for objective detection, prediction and assessment of diabetic retinopathy (DR) treatment outcomes. Develop and validate a software package (OpthoTool) with a graphical user interface that will have the option to process format agnostic retinal images from healthcare institutes and provide imaging biomarkers with disease prediction probabilities.
